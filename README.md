## [Live Deployment](https://liberlend.azurewebsites.net/)

## LiberLend Mission
LiberLendâ€™s mission is to maximize the use of an individual book by allowing communities to share their books among their members in an organized manner.

## Project Description
LiberLend is a free web application designed to streamline and maximize the ability of local communities to share books among their members. Users can add books they wish to make available to their virtual bookshelf which then can be viewed and reserved by other members of the community libraries that they create or join. When reservations are made, the contact information of the book owner and borrower are made available to each other. Arrangements for the physical exchange of the book can then be made.
